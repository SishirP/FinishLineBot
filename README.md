# FinishLineBot
An automation script that goes to the finishline website and buys the shoes for you, given the url of the shoe.
This script is built using Node.js, a popular JavaScript runtime, which enables automation of web interactions.
Utilizing the capabilities of Puppeteer, a headless Chrome browser API, the script navigates Finish Line's website just like a human user would, allowing it to perform tasks such as clicking buttons, filling out forms, and other cool things.

How it works:
Install node js and puppeteer, and open the comand line on the folder where the file is included, then run "node FinishLineBot.js", which will run the script.
